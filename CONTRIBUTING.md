[Commit message](#commit-message)

## Commit message
  * Each commit message should start with prefix which contains hash and issue number, for example "#132"
  * Commits which doesn't affect project build status like updating docs files "README.md" doesn't have to build by Travis CI. To do that commit message should contain sufix "[skip travis]"
